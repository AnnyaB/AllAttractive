# Personal Research Website (Work in Progress)

This repository contains the **early stages** of a personal website that will eventually serve as a **companion to my research in cosmology**. Development has only just begun, and the structure and content are evolving over time. Please note that this is **not a finished product**, but rather an iterative and explorative project.

##  Purpose

This website is part of a broader initiative to:
- Present ideas and progress in the field of **cosmology**
- Share insights, visualizations, and publications
- Engage others in scientific discourse
- Explore accessibility and design from a research communication standpoint

##  Image Credits

The images currently in use are **not yet referenced**. Proper attribution will be added in future commits once all assets have been finalized and verified.

##  Project Status

This project is still **under active development** and will take a **significant amount of time** to complete. The timeline is flexible and shaped by the flow of the ongoing research. Major additions and improvements are expected in future versions.

## Stack

This site is being built with:
- HTML5
- CSS3
- Vanilla JavaScript
- Node.js
- MongoDB

## Acknowledgements

This work is inspired by my ongoing journey in **cosmological studies** and aims to reflect not just content but clarity and usability in digital scientific communication.

**More to come. Stay tuned.**

**Issues to be fixed**
